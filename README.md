# Tab Saver
Saves tabs to a specified directory


This is a simple little tool that I built.

It allows me to save currently tabs to filesystem, overwrite pervious ones, and load these saved tabs.

also, it commits each change with git.

If anyone ever thinks it would be useful, i'll license MIT and maybe release on mozillas app market thing.

# TODO
- validate that session name strings are not empty (so it doesnt store ".json" files)
- merge sessions?
- basically need to support "inbox" -- there is something about this tab that I need to do
