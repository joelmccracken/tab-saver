#Tab Saver
Saves tabs to a specified directory


This is a simple little tool that I built.

It allows me to save currently tabs to filesystem, overwrite pervious ones, and load these saved tabs.

also, it commits each change with git.

If anyone ever thinks it would be useful, i'll license MIT and maybe release on mozillas app market thing.
